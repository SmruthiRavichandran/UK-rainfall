# UK Rainfall Analysis

## Overview
This project explores rainfall patterns in the UK using statistical and data visualization techniques. By leveraging historical rainfall data, it aims to uncover trends, anomalies, and insights useful for climate analysis and policymaking.
This project is based on 50 years of data that is collaborates and composed to learn the density of rainfall over UK

## Features
- Analysis of historical UK rainfall data.
- Visualization of trends and patterns.
- Support for exploring seasonal and regional rainfall variations.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn` 


## Dataset

The dataset includes monthly rainfall measurements across various regions in the UK from 19XX to 20XX. Data is sourced from https://www.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/d29ad7056f3548eb8affeb1c0ad50106

## Setup

```bash
python analysis.py
```

## Usage

### Data Preprocessing
The preprocessing script cleans and organizes raw rainfall data for analysis. Run:
```bash
python preprocess.py
```

### Visualization
Generate insightful visualizations to identify rainfall trends:
```bash
python visualize.py
```

## Key Findings
